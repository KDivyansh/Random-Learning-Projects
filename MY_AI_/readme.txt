I created this bot while watching a youtube video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdgVv4UP08c ).

This video is step by step tutorial of the code that I provided.
The bot has a limit of 1500 tokens which can be extended in the openai.py file under the token variable.

I created this for fun and in the way I learnt how to make a discord bot, use API's and interconnectivity of different platforms.

This is the link to the discord Server where you can test this out but for that you'll need to contact me first.
